pregnancy stuff they have always just waited until my next appointment to talk about my test results i also got my 2nd hpv booster because if my teenage sons are getting it i will too ive never had two days of pain from a pap smear usually just for a few hours afterwards maybe you should call your doctor and let them know just in case i have also never had any pain from a pap smear i second or third the idea that you should contact your doctor i have never had any pain after a pap smear it is a little uncomfortable but not painful even when i had a doctor who was hamfisted hopefully next

the pain is completely unrelated perhaps they dis3nchant what if you have hpv instead theflowernurse us fda or gardasil chubbysummy you really dont know the long term effects though like they pushed that gardasil shots on us to prevent cervical cancer and now there have been studies that it causes cervical cancer its just way to new to get right away in my opinion this is a wild take for many reasons also worth noting there is already an hpv vaccine mcc630 the hpv vaccine prevents the strains of hpv that can cause cervical or anal cancer it does not mean you wont get any hpv the reason behind vaccination is cancer prevention unfortunately that is misunderstood often kristi0 thats okay not taking it personally i understand your curiosity the flu vaccine changes yearly when they guess on the strain i dont like the thought of putting something foreign in our bodies when it might help again just my opinion as far as the hpv vaccine goes i have friends of mcc630 my sister never got the hpv vaccination this year she got diagnosed with high grade pre cancer which was related to her having hpv she is had her uterus lining cauterized and has to have check ups every 6 months she is now facing the possibility of not being able to have kids i guess you have to mcc630 there are so many strains of hpv the vaccine doesnt prevent all of them but can prevent the more aggressive strains which can cause cancer or genital warts i received the hpv vaccine as a teen and later did have a couple mild strains of hpv which resolved on their own my doctors have essentially mcc630 i got my hpv vaccine when i was younger and later married my husband who has hpv and ive never gotten it so it worked for me id say amylesch49 im shocked thank you for clarifying my kids will continue to get vaccines mandatory ones at least not a fan of the flu vaccine or hpv vaccine they are pushing the hpv vaccine on my 10 year old when he turns 11 thats a big fat no this is great news we have such an

wat yall want with ya bodies yanno but for my females if youse a big juicer and you never had a pap smear or got tested please do it is not an std i was cleared out all of them except hpv thank you for your response though i am at lost for words right now i noticed this hard pimple like bump near my libia and called my doctor he told me to come in well after examining me and asking me a bunch of questions and me saying no he asked if i ever had an abnormal pap and i said no but i did test positive for hpv he is now telling dont get too upset lots of people have hpvhsv the doctor will just do whatever treatment is needed when delivery comes i know its easier said than done but i promise theres a lot more people out there then youd think with those diagnoses and just because you have it does not mean youre nasty or dirty or i have hpv and its super common i had some precancerous cells removed a few years back and have been fine ever since i wouldnt worry too much i did have a couple small skin tags form when i got pregnant but they both fell off already ah youre right i didnt think about that warts dont have pus hm but if you tested positive for hpv that normally means either warts or cancer so i dont know im lost now either way if it is an std just try not to stress is over and done with no mysteries attached and no dragging it out i know sounds heartless but it is true just read some of the awful divorce stories here you will be able to clear up the hpv take a year or so to get yourself solid and happy with yourself and then if you decide to open the option to

with a cervix to get tested regularly your health matters stillgray they are also sharing hepatitis and hpv both have vaccines effectively its just that i think it is less than 1 of positive hpv cases turn cancerous so it can mean a lot of families do not know what to do about family planning if they have a positive hpv test i hope that makes sense it is a bit complicated i had my 8 week appt on wednesday where they did a pelvic exam and pap smear they said spotting may occur but its been three days and im still having some and had some pretty bad cramps the day after the exam these photos are the worst of it it mostly seems like crumbles of brown dried blood so i had my application last friday october 30 they checked my body temperature weight blood pressure asked me a lot of questions

smear and process in the uk my doctor told me i have to wait until i have this test to try for another baby but like i say many other countries do not operate this way and the vast vast majority of

have hpv again i dont remember when but at least pap smears did my immune system simply fight it 3 did it show up now because as a pregnant woman my immune system is slightly suppressed 4 was my husband clear of this before me or was he carrier all along 5 if he was clear did i just make him a carrier 6 does this mean i will just keep getting had it from a previous relationship and it was

request it and it was clear of 2 strains i think 16 and 18 which they noted causes cancer so here is where i am puzzled i have had normal paps for 20 years of those 20 years i was abstinent the last

have the nations attention and youre showing me hpv per annums bust out your superbowl material let us do something i think its most similar to a pap smear they really get up there definitely uncomfortable but its over really fast id rather get a pap smear from edward scissorhands than continue to watch this coverage hulu really wants me to get my teen child vaccinated for hpv 58255486 i only had one or two initially appear liquid nitrogen was used for those at the doctor i was traveling at the time another few popped up a week or two later i just used apple cider vinegar over a few nights and they scabbed and popped right off i have a decent tolerance for pain so i was fine 582506 acv works well i read that online but thought it was a meme i got them frozen and have some small residual ones left over and do not feel like going back to the doc its just a pain in the ass during covid and i want to treat it at home if i can 58251040 everyone has it wrong everyone has a specific strain of it most people are immune to it due to your genetic makeup specific people get specific types because they are not immune and it visibly shows on their bodies educate yourself

getting a pap smear i just had a pap smear today and i am definitely spotting but i read its normal as the cervix is sensitive and can get irritated easily how long has it been for you i had my pap smear today and am experiencing some light bleeding also a little nervous but it sounds like its normal the american cancer society is threatening to eliminate the pap test from front line screening typically needed every 3 years by replacing it with the hpv test every 5 years this puts women at a higher risk as the pap helps detect cervical cancer in women i just had a pap smear today and i am definitely spotting but i read its normal as the cervix is sensitive and can get irritated easily how long has it been for you i immediately thought of the before christ netflix show embarrassing

are asymptotic versions as well there is also no test for men the only reason i know i havehad it is because an ex was in the middle of the vaccination at least that was her story but ive never had any symptoms of anything 58251406 its probably keratosis pilaris you can get rid of it using lactic acid and retinol or laser hair removal but it takes a long time redpill me on hpv everyone has it do most people get genital warts in there life and they just get em removed and move on with life do all porn stars get hpv and just take a few weeks off when they get warts why is this the most common std but no one talks about it t got gw and having them frozen off 58252311 this i am in my 30s and have had it for like 18 years at this point 58252692 no never told anyone besides my wife if you do

fucked 2 girls that year by the end of that year i met the girl who today is my girlfriend my first wart appeared in april 2019 i did not know what hpv was so i didnt give a damn my gf got a wart too so i went to the doctor and he explained everything to me almost broke up 58251855 yea prob no way to tell unless you get warts i am pretty sure if you have had more than 4 partners chance that you have hpv is 99 i am just curious about people in porn do they just burn em off take a month break and get back to business i have had what i swear are warts for years but the doc always shrugs and my girlfriends always come back clean from the vag doctor so i am not stressing i guess they are something else since they are on the keratinized skin only i just freeze them off with compound w even though they say not to young guys do not possible to get throat cancer from eating out a girl with a high risk strain of hpv yes pretty unlikely though 58252536 implying the amount of sexual relations

happy place i do not recall much soreness after things settled 58251785 sorry i did not answer the how long did it take question it takes about 2 weeks for me to heal entirely burning it never did the freezing way anon if you have hpv do not sweat it my doctor said everyone has it some are just lucky they do not know it because they have no symptoms 58252439 what about the girl who gave it to him did she tell him she had it got genital warts after bottoming for a stranger from grindr they cleared after about two weeks and have not come back since brothers i have a mole on my peepee shaft thats been there for years urologists checked it out and its not an actual issue just cosmetically ugly should i get wart removal cream or something to get rid of it 58251155 i see i married my high school girlfriend that must be why if it is any consultation i took heavy penalties in my other stats to be fortunate enough to do that though so if i fucked like 910 girls half of them raw there is a very high chance that i have this fuck should i get the vaccine anyways my current gf went to the gynecologist and had the papanicolaou test and everything came all right what the fuck im never having sex

because i asked i mentioned i didnt have one early on like i thought i was supposed to and my previous one was probably 3 5 yrs ago and my ob said great lets do it now i dont think i would have gotten one otherwise i was about 20 weeks ish and she was doing a cervical check anyway no i had a pap when i was 9 weeks i just had mine at 23 weeks and had no bleeding or cramping at all i never do though

lost part of my before middayarmpit muscle because of a vaccine i waited to have my hpv vaccine because i wasnt sure when it first came out so i totally agree with you all for a vaccine that has never been shown to prevent cervical or any cancer but which has been positively associated with a greater than 45 increased risk of the same cancer in those who are vaccinated after hpv exposure

you can get it again if you have sex with someone else if you and your wife are just with each other you do not have any risk you mentioned something about transmitting it to other people the only way to transmit it is through sex your wife already has it you cannot give it to her again so i tryingfornumber21234 i have always had a doctor check i do it myself as well but i have never found it to be any more strange than a pap smear it is not like they are groping you on the exam table i got the hpv vaccine still got hpv and had 60 abnormal cells was told i had cervical cancer had two leeps all before the age of 24 still have abnormal paps this sounds fucking ridiculous find a new doctor as soon as possible and get the test fortunately and thankfully i am about to give birth to my baby girl you really shouldnt be having a pap during pregnancy as it could come back as false positive and cause unnecessary worry but i have had a normal pap with hpv positive and all did was cause unnecessary worry i would listen to your midwife honestly i got a cervical biopsy that was really completley unnecessary ive had hpv my doctor told me they dont usually test for it unless youre pap comes back abnormal they assume everyone has it already hpv really shouldnt be tested until 30 years old as a routine before 30 years it depends on the abnormal result if hpv status will change the course of management and to the person saying you should only see someone with doctor in their name i have a doctoral degree and am a nurse practitioner who i got cancer from hpv at 23 absolutely go find a doctor that will test you further they thought mine would be fine initially but it wasnt hi i had paps that went from abnormal to high risk to cancerous cells within 6months i was 21ish at the time and my ob also said they dont test for hpv for anyone under 26 its been a long time but im pretty sure this was the age they were saying 10 years ago only because my paps came back as mylittleherd2018 i started getting abnormal paps at 18 and was not tested until i was in my early 20s then of course somebody dropped the ball and forgot to tell me i tested positive for hpv until another doctor brought it up a few years later all the times i had abnormal paps i was lucky it never i worked at a gyno for 5 years and the doctor i worked for always did a paphpv but towards the end insurances

comparison in fact it illustrates just how much we have completely lost the forest from the trees when it comes to overall public health it is a lot of work because were just starting it would not be this quote from mudpuppy on october 30 2020 105454 am why do you think people do not give a shit i give many shits we work to lower transmission rates of other deadly diseases like hiv by advising protective practices we encourage vaccination for things like the flu and hpv what deadly diseases do you for things like the flu and hpv what deadly diseases do you believe people are apathetic about spreading the work we do to lower transmission of these viruses is a millionth of the sacrifices that government has asked in response to covid comparing wearing condoms and getting vaccines to people giving troublesome or expensive i am so so ashamed to admit now and so on i honestly do not remember ever hearing that people died of the flu when i was a teen or young college student but of course i did not watch the news back then and the internet had not been invented yet so maybe that is a little excuse but honestly not while pregnant but i have had this happen went for a colposcopy and they did a biopsy at the same time they then proceed based on how the biopsy comes back if youre pregnant im not sure if they would even do a biopsy or not try not to worry too much technically the colposcopy is just a close up anymore because i wouldnt quarantine my ds for 2 weeks before her kids birthday party hes uninvited the same woman has never had a smear test in her like such is her grasp of being health aware what 11 year old would even know this is an option laughing out loud they say 11 but i just cant see an 11 year old suddenly getting passionate about vaccines and taking it upon themselves to go get some shots i can see a high school aged minor taking an interest in vaccinations specifically in a case where maybe a in a way i think this could be a good thing although i think 16 would probably be better i have a coworker who goes on and on about how she has decided her kids are not allowed to get the hpv vaccine i asked her why and she said she just feels its unnecessary i told her how it can prevent cervical example could likely be sexually active and should be able to get the hpv vacc i think there are several years before being 18 that a child is informed enough to want to be vaccinated when i was in high school i was absolutely educated on vaccines and would have chosen to get them had my parents denied genital warts healing process recovery

the hpv is unnecessary and for my kids in particular completely absurd at their age potatohead630 in my opinion requiring a vaccine for a disease that is sexually transmitted is much different from requiring one that is caught because it is airborne apples and oranges i would have a problem with a schoolgovt telling me i have to get my child vaccinated for hpv and i am as provax as they 285951791 prep is incredibly unhealthy for the body only in rare cases of preexisting liver conditions and even then there is no evidence of permanent damage for the average person there is no

warts cus they just 103596622 103596623 ill educate you guys cus i learned alot during my doctor visit warts are caused by hpv genital warts and the normal kind and if you have been sexually active

years quick swab in there took just a few minutes and she could tell i had an infection right then and there i would go in and insist you atleast get a quick swab before you leave you know when something is off on 2 different appointments i told the drnurse that i had a lot of discharge and after having positive bv tests 4 times in the last year i was concerned they told me both times it was probably just a yeast infection and take monistat i finally do no change at all tell another dr at my next appt and im not sure honestly i would ask her why she wont if you have bv and are pregnant it can cause all sorts of things like preterm labor i would think she should take it pretty seriously if your feeling symptoms i dont have symptoms of bv just a bad smell im 31 weeks is that why she wont give me one what if ive had it for awhile thats alarming i didnt even know i had bv the only reason i found out was because i was having mild period cramps for four days so i called they had me come in tested me and it came back positive i would absolutely ask why they wont test you for bv keep advocating for yourself mama if you dont feel i didnt even know i had bv had no symptoms other than a stinging sensation after me and my husband would have sex she swabbed and during it she said i had discharge that looked like bv but i literally had no symptoms of what she was saying and sure enough it came back positive for bv so id definitely maybe oder isnt a part of bv i do not know i had it once in my second trimester all the bad things i have heard about that vaccine and it included even more horrifying statistics about deaths severe adverse reactions and so on it is so dangerous and it does not even protect against all strains of the disease best prevention is condomssafe sex for

is helpful not just for people with hpv but everyone i would say it is true that men cannot really be diagnosed with it but my gynae actually recommended for my partner to be vaccinated as well i recently spoke to another friend who just went through radical hi aaligatorcake1 i am actually looking through this forum for women who were previously vaccinated with gardasil4 which i assume is what you got in 2013 and their experience receiving the gardasil9 vaccination how many doses did your dr recommended for you i am curious because i am considering handthrumyhair i got a hpv shot could you just get the hpv jab you can pay for it at your gp an interesting ask wonder a tad myself on stuff related to this so much either goes unsaid or or is it known by med profession in your case as long as you have regular smear checks and are monogamous with your dh if you have not already picked up hpv unlikely to i have read it is like contracting other i had hpv with abnormal cells and i was really worried about this but to put it in perspective hpv is linked to several cancers including throat cancer yet most people dont avoid oral sex from fear of catching hpv orally thankfully my body got rid of the hpv so im not so worried anymore all you can but are you having anal sex exclusively to avoid the risk of getting cervical cancer because if your dh or you had hpv from a previous relationship youre at risk of cervical cancer and anal cancer too you can get an hpv test you are no more at risk of anal cancer than cervical and if your smear is hpv can also cause cervical cancer

often for a pap and usually it resolves on its own now that im pregnant i was worried but she told me theres no risk to the baby try not to stress youre abnormal cells are likely low grade and will clear up on their own the absolute worst case scenerio if they continue to develop is that you will need them lasered off which i had done almost 10 years ago it will not affect your pregnancy at all and your doctor will likely just see hpv is normally no big deal when i had an abnormal pap a few years ago they sent me for a biopsy and told me to start taking a prenatal and selenium to improve healing went back a year later and everything was fine i had an abnormal pap 5 years ago because of hpv and by my next pap a year later it cleared up they just take a very small portion of the cervix more like a scrape and your cervix regenerates in 46 weeks after some of it is removed dont worry about it hpv happens to roughly 80 of people and most dont i had a smear what we call it in the uk

test i was right and i just have to go back when im 26 weeks but i never heard much about it and my dr never mentioned anything i never really asked because i was just upset and scared i never had medications or treatments or anything i got a pap a year later and it was normal and they always have been since hpv is so common like most sexually active people get definitely stay away from google

hormonal imbalance and its not uncommon to experience this condition once in while due stress changes in weight or diet at this time you need to wait at least 7 days after your missed period and you should take a pregnancy test for the most accurate result thank you yes i will still take a pregnancy test just to be on the safe side but even though the flow was light it lasted for 56 days i am also currently uninsured i was wondering how do i go about getting on birth control and does that require a doctors visit ok have you missed your period how many days is your period late when was your last unprotected sexual intercourse hi i have a question in terms of my period are you using any contraceptives when did your last period begin no and last thursday doctors assistant when was your last pap test and what were the results any swelling discoloration or unusual smells i have never had a pap test the spotting was light okay so even though i had a heavy flow while urinating is that still considered a small amount of spotting or bleeding ok the most important is to rule out pregnancy first i understand your concern but to get a prescription for birth control you will need to see doctor in person thank you it could be considered normal like a period and usually implantation bleeding should resolve in a few hours or 23 days if your bleeding turns heavier or if you start passing clots you need to contact your doctor for further evaluation you need to keep eye on this symptoms i hope i was able to help you a for the most part sometimes my periods are a little heavy they occur

and they prescribed me a valium to take before the procedure and it was exactly what i needed the discomfort was gone in a day and i forget its there all the time i was in and out in 5 minutes i had mine removed one week after my period did not get my period back until after i gave birth to my dd it was no worse than having a pap smear or cervical biopsy done for me preparing for a covid test today prior to my trip i asked a friend who recently took it if it was painful and she said i would compare it to a pap smear for you face do i really need to travel httpst cou66e541btg 285099060 for the last time you fucking retard it is spelled gardasil hearing some ladies are struggling to get their smear test appointments so just hope surgeries can all ensure this vital test is done as soon as possible i had the exact same feeling with my first i was actually a virgin so neednt have had it done really and she used the large speculum thing i had tears streaming down my face because it just didnt fit in begged her to use the smaller one but she said that was for shorter girls and i was very tall because it is an invasive and violating experience many women have this experience i think we have to be careful with language and understand there is a big element of individual referencing if the message we are sending out to young women is that the procedure is very likely to leave you feeling so violated no way ott unless you have related history that is a massive over reaction to a standard medical procedure in 2015 i had an massive non cancerous ovarian cyst which was pushing my uterus to one side i had to have a smear prior to being operated on and i went to my local clinic who could not do i hated all mine all painful am too old to be called for them now but sympathies with all women having them a couple of times i had the dreaded call back to go again as they had not got enough cells i always went and later learned to have paracetamol beforehand do not know that it helped but i felt i completely understand how you would feel violated having said that it is not very common to have such an awful reaction to it especially when it is done gently i think the poster who suggested counselling probably meant something like nlp perhaps to change your associations around the examination in shit one also not all women have children so all this talk of it only gets worse is not relevant andor helpful as for did i complain no i cannot say it even occurred to me at the time i was younger less assertive and caught up in my own pain on some level i knew that the nurse did not want to and i completely agree it does feel violating i had an internal scan years ago on a gynae ward man walked in halfway through took the probe from the female doctors hand whilst the probe was still in my vagina and carried on scanning he didnt even tell me his name or ask if he could take over i baringmyclaws lotusoak2 the long term efficacy and safety data of the clinical trials do not support what you insinuate the corona vax trials found issues so it was stopped that would have been the case for hpv if any issues were found i am getting a pap smear done friday by a new doctor and referred to him as my cooter dooter intruder and i cannot stop laughing did you know most people infected with hpv do not know they have it the hpv vaccine is the best way to help prevent hpv and hpvrelated cancers vaccineswork vaccination hpvvaccine 2shots2stopcancer httpst coasxsxrefvu 285096600 gadrasil syndrome is a genetic disease caused by hpv vaccination it prevents the body from reabsorbing histamine leading to orgasm failure and lack of erection this effect occurs in all children and grandchildren of those vaccinated it may well be that youll need a sedative before your next exam i actually needed one when i had an mri scan on my head dont bottle up your fears speak to someone now before your feelings become worse i hope you find a good way to deal with you could get a self sampling kit they are about 50 they only test for hpv not abnormal cells but i believe that is all the national health service smear tests for as well these days to treatment but i feel the pressure put on women to have smears does impact your freedom to choose if they could find a less invasive procedure uptake would be significantly higher they have been talking about an alternative for years and if it were a male problem this would have been developed and rolled i have had five or 6 smears as well as various other gynaecological examinations and a baby with all that entails usually i feel fine afterward just once when i had a colposcopy not even my first colposcopy and then a biopsy i felt similar to how youre feeling op the nurses and the gynaecologist and much much longer than a smear i only felt violated for a day or two then it faded but i remember literally using that language to my dh and direct message to describe how i felt violated so try not to dwell on the feeling and just accept youve had a medical instrument shoved up your hooha of course you feel i feel the pressure put on women to have smears does impact your freedom to choose it doesnt none of the procedures people imagine to be compulsory vaccinations smears smoking testsblood tests during pregnancy are anything other than entirely at the patients discretion thousands of women went through on the day you had your smear it is normal it is necessary youve said the procedure was carried out sensitively which is great things have improved a lot since i had my first smear millions of european and american women go voluntarily to their gynaecologist every six months yes flu shot time of year im down for mine sometime in early november plus am due next shot for hpv vaccine and some other booster ive been quite impressed as the id clinic have topped me with with several different vaccines this year other than that i hate the dark evenings this time of year brings michelamaxwell now is the time to stock up on plan b create fundraisers for medical needs and seriously doctor shop to get as much bc as you can i am too and make sure all the teens and young adults have access to the hpv vax god we have so much work to do before christ people are full of hate it seems like the tvland ad on the hpv vaccination are targeted towards the libtard minority group please force all your 12 year olds to take the vaccination and rid societyof stupidity with the deathly side affectects ladies and yes some of you gents with sizable mammary glands have you had your breast exam yet

assumptions more than any human being i know cervical cancer is a problem the lack of proof you clowns try to pass off as evidence is also a problem gardasil not preventing cervical cancer is our 3rd problem nhsuk advice on how to get an appointment please 12 months ago had abnormal cells after a smear test given a further appt for april 2020 turned up for appt door locked receptionist shouted through the door it is closed have now received a letter saying i didnt turn up for appt no one likes it it is something that has to be done i breathe deeply and have a day dream during it i think there was one time i held a nurses hand during it it also helps me to think about it in terms of its their job and when you deal with bodies as part of a job its different for them its not my mother never had a smear she died 3 months ago of cervical cancer watching her die of cancer was far more traumatic for me than any smear test has ever been nobody forced you into it you made an informed choice and did so knowing the benefits outweighed the negatives the first one is always the worst really strongly believe that if men had to undergo something like this an alternative less invasive method would have been found decades ago men do have also intimate examinations like sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies in decades to come they will look back at our medical procedures with the same horror that is had loads of smear tests and internals and to be honest i think this feeling of violation is worse the more times goes on last time i had to have internal scan i was so upset i cant think of any particularly traumatic experiences that would have meant it makes me feel so bad but it just gets worse yes i i have had a couple of upsetting ones they do stick in your mind but the feelings of panic and shame do fade with time closing your eyes and practicing relaxing breathing can really help as can having something nice planned for the following days it is always worth asking when you make the appointment for a did some research and decided that as i was very low risk and because of the issues with false positives that i would not have another i am now almost 60 i did not know about the hpv postal test though and will look into that partners have had few partners are at a lower risk of hpv this doesnt mean you can ignore screening opportunities but you could choose a more dignified method secondly valid though your feeling are it would be ok to talk to an hcp or counsellor if it would help to reduce your negative feelings and gain a smears are horrible and i have never met someone happy to have one i have had a few and they were as painful as however one year it caught something and i had treatment i use that to remind myself that despite the embarrassment and pain it helped me from long term issues and illness thats all ive got my understanding is that a prostate examination which also involves an internal examination is no fun at all but the method has stayed the same for at least a hundred years no they have got a simple blood test for that now i really strongly believe that if men had to undergo something like this an alternative less invasive method would have been found decades ago people swing around the word counselling as a cure for trauma i still remember it it affects me less as i get older but when i told my mum years later i remember how horrified she was that she had encouraged me you are ok and justified in your feelings it is a violating procedure it is hideous for me gail andruszczak because with any vaccine it takes a percentage of a population to achieve over all immunity or herd immunity there is no such thing as natural immunity they have yet to find out if having this virus once creates any immunity at all or if it dies how long it lasts vaccines have eradicated usysinc newscientist not dead does not mean that you did not contract toxoplasmosis cats can also get the hpv among many other infectious diseases

everyone will listen but people need to know the risks and we all know that the doctors will not be informing them this is long but everyone should read it httpst co5mxonbkmzy it is in no way a strange reaction i have however gone from being practically tearful and full of dread prior to a smear when i was younger to seeing it as a mild inconvenience at 31 and after having ds i do not think anyone in the world likes having a smear test i just grit my teeth and think it is a minute of my life and then it is over i have a friend who had cervical cancer when she was very young treatment is so much more lengthy and invasive then a smear please do what you need to do to make sure you real regardless of the fact that she was not actually violated so a very important part of dealing with that is to keep saying to herself and remembering that she was not violated and that she is safe your approach is actually far more dismissive of her feelings by essentially brushing them under the carpet dragon7f1 guardian oh dear there is so much about vaccines you should learn supreme court ruled them unavoidably unsafe look into gardasil for example covid vaccine with the lack of testing will be one of the worst they actually have an hpv vaccine now wonder if it was underway when that ep was shot thewestwing s5 16 12277619 read the excerpt adjuvants in vaccines have been known since the 1980s to cause multiple sclerosis in susceptible individuals later in the article it cites a study on several people who developed lupus after receiving a hpv vaccine these things happen in practice stop blindly shilling and i agree with frenchsticks approach the op wasnt violated as she consented to the medical procedure she is presumably clear in her own mind about the benefits of screening reminding herself that she had agency and choice over the procedure may help her get a sense of empowerment back and address that feels she was but she was not so we can offer advice as to how she can process those feelings so that she understands them better and hopefully does not let them overwhelm her by reassuring her that she is safe and she was not violated or we can just say yup having a smear will always feel like that nothing say they enjoy getting a smear and for many they are actually quite painful so i fully understand hating getting it done but you were not violated and you do need to readjust your thinking to understand your feelings because if you convince yourself that you have been a victim of something then youre totally see where you are coming from i have had quite a few and always have to go elsewhere in my head during and after no matter how nice the nurse is mine stems from my first pregnancy test over 40 years ago the dr just ploughed right in there student in tow my next smear was worse the female dr i am constantly amazed that some people can not seem to understand how complex and varied humans are the op clearly says she feels violated not that she thinks she was violated this is not an unheard of feeling health professionals understand this it is this persons first smear just a bit of trauma does usually resolve naturally in a few months it is raw now but your brain will be trying to process it and then the emotional charge will reduce it is likely that 3 years from now the screening method will be different and even if it is not it is highly highly unlikely you will still feel how you that doing it on your side can be more comfortable and it was better that way though i had to have one leg stuck in the air which she eventually put on a convenient shelf as it became apparent that i was never good at gymnastics also the new disposable plastic speculums are much better than the old metal apologies maryshelley if you thought i was being abusive i actually find it really upsetting when people discuss how horrible they find smear tests and people weigh in with oh there is nothing wrong with smear tests there must be something wrong with you that was how your post read to me i have no tips i am afraid the nurse who did my first and only smear was not kind and i feel violated to this day i am considering purchasing a selfsampling kit seeing as they are now available privately not on the national health service but it will either tell me everything is fine or i need follow up and i am not sure i had a traumatic smear in my 20s the gp brought in a male student same age as me stating of course she does not mind then scraped me really hard i was in agony for 2 days as i was dressing behind the curtain there was a bang on the door and she let a man in who was delivering medicines being young i you are low risk monogamouspartner has not had many partners it may even be better for you to opt outonly you can decide that but you may wish to look at the work of dr margaret mccartney a gp who refuses screening maryshelley i have had two children and i still find smears traumatic fuck off with your minimising honestly id get some counselling why do you feel violated from what you have said you were fully informed and treated with respect by the dr not sure how that equates to violation i have never had a smear is this not the same as a sti checkup they put the crank in you with jelly and take the swabs i am due my first soon i completely get where youre coming from and of course youre not wrong to feel how you feel i also find smear tests extremely difficult even traumatic and i am in my 40s now so have had a fair few it is violating there is no way around that if that is how you experience it i do not have any advice do you have anything in your history that would cause you to feel like this obviously it is not a normal reaction to feel so strongly about a medical procedure that you describe as being carried out appropriately and with sensitivity i cannot say i enjoy them but have had much worse i presume you do not have my children have 3 grandmas and 2 grandpas everyone wanted those names so whatever we refer to them as grandma and grandpa insert first name edit to add i really dont like pappy laughing out loud reminds me of a pap smear and what is rayray i dont even understand it well its unique all right so over the next 6 months i will be rationing and stock piling my medications getting all of my annual and biannual exams ekg pft echo pap smear blood work and seeing all of my specialists one last time before my health insurance is taken away ok cool cool i am genuinely shocked at the amount of people who seem to think that being bundled into a locked ambulance and digitally raped is trivial one woman it happened to said they had their cervixes examined a pap smear is a painful enough procedure even when you have given your doctor consent so they would still present even if you circumcised in a low style commonly practised in europe and africa where the foreskin is actually completely removed youre still not completely protected against hiv so i would rather just use a condom or stick with one partner that is tested i did and i am still glad for it how i got cured from canceri was diagnosed of cancer and i have tried all i can to get cured

bones if it feels tensed intentionally let it loose it takes about two minutes and is rea have them explain what they a re doing and just watch your phone or breathe deeply for a few minutes it only lasts an extremely short time may be uncomfortable should not be painful dont let them put you to sleep 5 minutes the whole appointment typically takes about 10 minutes the staff will explain everything to you first in order to make it easier for you nb you cannot be having your period during the pap smear if you get it that day then cancel the appointment and go back after it is finished

my god i do not know what i was thinking but i did not expect for her to open up cervix i mean it wasnt a lot but still the pain was so intense i felt like i was having before because i need all the info ahead of time but experiences definitely vary its not comfortable but it isnt as bad as a pap smear and just a warning the wand was larger than i imagined i often go an overly optimistic route

about induction and so on its a heck of a lot easier than a pap smear no tools thank goodness and i told myself i better do it to get ready for the poking and prodding come i felt the same way i have had two so far and i will take it over a pap smear any day no pain just slightly uncomfortable anyone else have a pap smear during the two week wait and turned up pregnant i am 3dpo and just had my

had one flare up which oddly was right when trying to get pregnant he went and got removed and we waited two weeks and thought we lost that window but low and behold i was pregnant so i know exactly when conceived i got the vaccine years ago and have tested negative hpv strains either cause warts or potentially cervical cancer not skin tags and as others said hpv can lay dormant for many years i think you are over thinking and stressing over probably nothing but if it happen to be hpv its possible you could have had it prior to your boyfriend my doctor told me years ago almost every single person will get hpv in their life i had an abormal pap and she said we wouldnt even test for hpv bcuz thats 90 of the time what it is i definitely do not think he cheated based off of hpv dont worry the dr will know if you call and make an apt but could it be folliculitis i used to get little bumps when i was like 20 and then it came back with my first two pregnancies and this one it hasnt so i think its completely gone a wart or skin tag without hpv doesnt mean your bf cheated its impossible does the bump have a head or is it all just raised skin have you tried to squeeze it to see if anything comes out does it itch any other bumps down there have you checked inside the vaginal folds to see if there are bumps i wouldnt jump to the conclusion it is hpv i know easier said than done but my understanding is that certain strains of hpv would cause genital warts not skin tags i have gotten so many skin tags this pregnancy and none in my previous ones its so weird definitely talk to your dr to ease your mind and try not to stress cuz thats easy right and as pages have said it can lay skin tags are not hpv related i get a ton at the end of each pregnancy its hormones i feel like youre overreacting honestly adding this at one of my first appointments i got a pap smear and the lab somehow mixed up everyones samples from that day so they did a repeat and i never heard the results or anything she said say at my third appointment that she saw i needed a pap but that i had one not long ago and it looked good i im sorry this has to be stressful id stay calm until you can have your doctor test many people grow tags during pregnancy also hpv can lay dormant for years before popping up and pregnancy tends to make it grow faster because our cells are multiplying quickly and so on hpv usually does not show symptoms for like ten years but in some cases it can be weeks and usually it is a genital wart and not a skin tag youre probably just one of the pregnant women who get skin tags randomly laughing out loud only two outside of family one was a surprise hug from a close friend thanking me for a birthday gift he sprung it on me he is a natural hugger and think was

even if i already had a pap smear and really im not sure if they will let my little one go in and my husband doesnt want to be alone with her he gets scared your gp was correct you do not need to get tested unless you are due to be tested it doesnt matter if you have given birth in the mean time cervical check recommend that if you are due to have a test and have given birth you should wait 3 months the issue with getting tested privately is that depending the test done for cervical screening now is called a hpv test so it checks for the human papilloma virus the old test was called a cervical smear so this would check for changes in your cervical cells the new test does not do this i dont know why you would need an up to date smear test for this how strange it sounds like it might be polyps or fibroids and your gp could refer you for a scan ive had similar and i had cysts was referred to gynae for a laparoscopy where they diagnosed endometriosis and removed cysts too keep it definitely is a slippery slope i took a look at my records and ive apparently been vaccinated 5 times for hpv i dont know how i got extra shots but i guess it doesnt hurt i bottom occasionally but 90 percent of the time im the top im also negative i just turned 30 young but not that young oh hon i am sorry you are so worried about this the chances of you getting hpv this way from such a brief act are slim to none given your extremely low to no risk activity and your negative and excessive testing you can put this behind you now i wouldnt have ever recommended testing for you i hope what is the

checked and cleared than ignore it and find out later i have something i have one scheduled for 2 days from now better safe than sorry i had a pap smear as soon as my postpartum bleeding stopped because that is had a lot of abnormal ones so i need them every 6 months and couldnt get one done while i was pregnant its only a minute of being uncomfortable i recommend that you get it done my doctor recommended to get a pap 6 months after a baby a pap will check for cancers it has nothing to do with having your period or not i get that you are nervous about things going in there after having a baby but its really important especially because hormone levels play a part in reproductive health and as new moms our hormones are still out of whack im scheduled for mine on 1120 im not too worried about it i would rather have it done even if it is uncomfortable it lasts about two seconds and can be lifesaving my doctor did an internal exam at 6 weeks pages as well i had a pap 6 weeks pages with no issues they just want to make sure youre okay they may do a pap smear if youve never had one before it might be uncomfortable but it doesnt hurt just uncomfortable morally laughing out

new doctor told me they only test for 161845 which came negative with abnormal pap so they cannot tell me which hpv places where it is so any kind of abnormal result is more concerning in someone that

consult a gynaecologist for this you will need a repeat pap smear and tests like ultrasound to rule out any deep seated infection and other conditions of the reproductive system you should go for an

its about the size of a quarter is this normal are you using any contraceptives when did your last period begin no last month around the bleeding or irregular bleeding at this age it is rare but it

years is recommended even after ablation yes this could be normal the fact that you have abnormal cycles anything is game how old are you if you are over 40 this could be that you are approaching the

cancer which can be from hpv a sexually transmitted disease first time this ever came up on a pap smear and mine have always said normal in this part not metaplastic cells present i got my pap smear results and everything was normal except this i know its not considered normal but its not cancerous either has this happened to anyone or does anyone have any info regarding this result if it were serious enough my ob wouldve called and im sure we will discuss it at my 13 week so i am 12 weeks 4 days today i had a doppler scan lab work pap smear and so on all done at my appt today i am 23 years old and this is my first pregnancy i have history of cancers on my fathers side lung and breast with both of my paternal grandparents but other than that do not have a history of any today was my first time meeting my doctor so the nurse came in with a doppler to hear the heart beat and after about 5 min she couldnt find one so another nurse came in to try and she couldnt find one at this point i was already going to burst into tears bc i had a miscarriage last year so the doctor came when i had my first i took baby with me she stayed in the stroller the whole time they basically do a pap smear to make sure all is good down there im not sure if the clinics will currently allow you to take baby due to covid id definitely double check with your clinic just to be safe i dont see why weaponizedword1 hello i see you have an affinity for the science of hpv vaccines here is a list of studies that may interest you hpv libertylives277 ephron j rascallycake you know nuttin httpst

people get a weird reading just from pregnancy if he was concerned he would have referred you for a colposcopy or a pap at your 6 week follow up and hes not even doing that dont worry this happened when i was pregnant with my second they said it was probably abnormal due to the pregnancy at my postpartum appointment i got a follow up pap that came out fine i just got my test results and my dr said there was a slight abnormality in my pap but i tested negative for hpv she said we will just need a follow up pap a year from now i had an abnormal pap about 8 years ago followed up with a colposcopy which was goodnormal and i have had 2 normal paps since then like fatigue reduced cognitive ability increased susceptibility to other illnesses no im talking about longer term some viruses lead to cancer for example think about hpv weve got millions of guinea pigs out there who may have secondary and tertiary covid effects it is standard practice at our doctors office to get a pap smear at your first prenatal appointment it does not harm baby dont freak out i had the exact same thing with my first pregnancy and she basically removed the abnormal cell and ive had a normal pap since sometimes the pregnancy hormone can cause irregularities like that and ive been told literally around 80 of women have hpv i hope everything goes well for you hi ladies this is my 2nd month ttc after my miscarriage the last two periods since my miscarriage in july have left me with painful cramps and sharp pains the week prior ive done all of my blood tests sonohystogram pap test ultrasounds and still feel this pain and still am not pregnant im worried anyone ever had one this is my first pregnancy and im not worried for some reason but kinda nervous about not being prepared last minute i tense up doing a pap smear so i do not know cant imagine what will happen i want to say ill be fine but i also want to be prepared when to get one is it worth it cruzrc88 do not forget to get your hpv vaccine my old coworker told us including the boss that she has hpv why i do not fucking know does hpv count abnormal paps how about herpes cold sores are herpes if it does than probably a lot of people i have a history of high risk hpv and was told that if my cells came back abnormal then they wouldnt do a biopsy until after i had my baby thankfully it came back normal i dont know what i would have done if it wasnt the case in my experience the biopsies really hurt but i dont think they would be a my obgyn says its up to me but she proposed it too cuz my pap smear came out abnormal i was so shocked i have seen even a drop of blood since i got pregnant i have read about this its mild but can cause some bleeding any blood i see now will scare me cuz i will think it has to do with my baby i these men on the bachelorette crying about a covid nasal swab have clearly never had a pap smear slightpinch trutv i watch tru tv all day every day and if i see the commercial with the girl saying the lamp has hpv for life again i am going to kill myself please stop i have always wondered this quote view post so you gotta wait till december no got my flu shot need to go in december for a pap test she told me that yesterday when i talked to her yesterday i stopped shaving last year my husband does not care so i do not care either for my pap smear i did clean up a bit and i will shave completely when i give birth like i have always done noelle ballard no thats gardasil that like burns this one just made my before midday soo sore lionelmedia also in my opinion there is no benefit obtained from this vaccine cervical cancer rates which have been very low since the intro of the pap smear test are now on the rise since intro of hpv vax its having opposite effect of that which was intended oh hell no nik oh my god josh tweeted that he has hpv me what he wouldnt tweet that me ohh he said hes a witch with hpv he didnt get the reference lmaoo tarawreckdem nope lionelmedia im working praying for the day that gardasil other toxic vaccines products are a part of the past that your question will not even need to be asked i am with you dr t 283053605 hpv virus jasmineleecf i mean men can get that from a woman herpes the clap causes infertility so many stds are terrible and a few are fatal hep c syphilis hiv chlamydia hpv men and women spread these things t quit your insurance at anytime you want you have to do so in writing and jump through other hoops just to get out of that insurance i know i tried getting out of a policy this year it took time but i finally got it closed meanwhile i have no backup for that coverage tell me when any insurance company a thread worth reading 2020 the gynecologist emails you a reminder to get a pap smear and you actually look forward to it because it gives you something to do compared with unvaccinated women the risk among women vaccinated before age 17 dropped by almost 90 hpv vaccine they will most likely do a pap smear if you havent had one recently they usually also do a pelvic exam or check your cervix they will then do either an transvaginal ultrasound or abdominal ultrasound depending on how far along you are they will measure the baby and give you your due date and check the absolutely not lesserspottedh just got it today and my first round of hpv i had a dreadful fear that during my pap smear the tool would get caught on the strings of my mirena my anxiety was high level shit im glad you asked about this i had my first in person visit today 7 weeks and got a pap smear and ultrasound but no urine or blood test my np says they do the blood test at 12 weeks i was so taken aback because it seems like everyone else gets tons done at their first appointment so im glad im not not discussed just admin and a pap smear i had an ultrasound but the technician told me nothing except looks ok is this normal i feel alone and no information i will be a feet and am in british columbia canada i am an endometriosis sufferer too and high risk i never got a q tip up that area they usually just swab your v at my doctor i was tested when i got my pap smear which was my first pregnancy appointment and apparently tested positive they wont test me again they just told me that when i think im going into labor that i need to go to the hospital and this is why i have warned against gardisil since 2016 which i stated on the oprah show i had one done but not pregnant my results came back with bad levels of hpv so i had to have a leep also to get out the bad tissue most women have really mild traces of hpv that go away on their own its not painful but uncomfortable for sure ive had multiple 5 colposcopies over the last 8 years and theyve all come back normal ive had multiple abnormal paps and hpv ive never had them during pregnancy but i dont think theyd do them if it werent safe i think its more just to monitor bc they wont be able to biopsy the cervix or i did an oma podcast on the importance of the hpv vaccine i stressed that covid is messing up students getting the hpv vaccines and multiple news outlets are on it parents get grade 78 students their hpv vaccine httpst cog4jdvnfasi ontariosdoctors ontarioobgyns natural citizen said born with a cervix cervix is latin for neck whether it is the neck of the uterus or the neck that attaches you head to your shoulders people can be so stupid slander some greek family name get a pap smear the doctors breathing real heavy over the microscope decided whether he my doctors said my cervix is nice and healthy so i have that to look forward too be sure you get your hpv vaccine as soon as possible drgenack thesleepyrebel daniellemerrim1 i was thinking that gwyneth should have a scent called my last pap smear sorry if that offends i have been sitting on the idea for weeks i had abnormal cells and was hpv negative with my 2nd pregnancy and was back to normal postpartum i think it was checked again 5 months later very common to have abnormal cells during pregnancy i had abnormal cells and negative hpv test years ago had a colposcopy and everything looked ok did not need a leep so i just repeated the pap again 6 months later and it was normal and it has been normal ever since then it is very common to get this result my sister had abnormal cells once too and did i have abnormal cells i have hpv type 16 i have colposcopies done each year to monitor hpv 80 of people have it welcome to the club it is most likely due to hpv most strains go away on their own even if the strain goes away the cells may linger for up to 7 years so they will just keep an eye on it every year to make sure nothing is progressing it is estimated that 80 of all adults have had hpv at some point in their life its not could be a low grade hpv that will go away on its own or a false reading that is had both control methods are introduced the number of average children tends to fall below replacement i mean he could be up to something insidious but considering his track record soo far i do not think there is actual reason to believe he would be taking his agenda to the extreme if he had some dark secret plan he i keep

effective at preventing hpv related cancers httpst coykusdzkcyq hpvfacts hpvawareness test it kinda felt more like a pap test he assured me he did not put his finger or swab into my cervix just the

like pap test are you interested in viruses and cancer we have a phd opportunity to study hpv rna interactions based on our recent work in plos pathogens httpst cojfdsqrcrru scienceleeds bbsrcwhiterose phd opportunity on findaphd httpst co784pacd2vh yes its normal your cervix is very sensitive during pregnancy so its normal to have spotting after sexa pap smearanything has been near it however if you have having a gush of blood or filling a pad you absolutely should contact your physician in my 20s i had a couple abnormal paps in a row so they did a colposcopy they will look at your cervix with magnification and spray a solution to help visualize abnormal cells if they see something they will numb the area and do a biopsy my first colposcopy they didnt see anything to biopsy a year later when i was about 19 or 20 i had an abnormal pap and got a colposcopy they never really said anything when i had another pap at 23 they said i had hpv the kind that can cause cancer i had no symptoms or issues i was told it would go away on its on and wasnt really anything to worry about when i found i had this after my first birth i had a leep procedure at 9 weeks postpartum it wasnt a great experience but i havent had an abnormal pap smear since and have gone on to have 3 more vaginal births this was in 2009 paoxoxo it was not cancerous low grade abnormal i have had normal paps ever since that biopsy so it probably helped get back to normal faster when you are over 30 they start testing for a couple strains of hpv that are high risk for leading to cervical cancer my test came back positive even though paoxoxo it just feels like a pinch from what i remember its been several years since ive had it done but i dont remember it being too bad and if its hpv itll go away on its own in time it sounds way scarier than it actually is during my pregnancy they did a pap smear my cells were slightly abnormal now that i gave birth they did a pap smear again it also came out abnormal so i need to schedule an appointment where they take a piece of my cervix im nervous that it could be something serious anyone else had to go thru this i had 25 radiation 5 brachytherapys 5 chemo s thyroidectomy two taxol chemos finally let me rest to get my blood count above zero so tired but fighting this youi persevere and we live good and long as we can tell all the hpv vaccine important very important wondersmom2 oh really it is like a pap test type of feeling i am scared that it is going to be painful 17446627 the power is within you and so is the craving which will only get stronger by the way get safe hpv vaccine prep choose a safe guy or girl and explore your sexuality way easier than a smear test i have had countless tv ultrasounds with ivf and it does not go past the cervix so there should not be pain or anything more than mild discomfort nurse is normally sitting to the side and concentrating on the monitor and may move the probe a bit to get better images but ivf here as well i get one weekly through 12 weeks and during the ivf process i lost count its nothing like a pap smear its like a thin dildo i dont know a better way to describe it about the same width as your thumb with a condom on it they put ultrasound gel on the wand gently insert it and even if it does change my body can get rid of it would i ever know if it mutated at all i hope not thank you so much storry i mean a hpv infection in the mouth i have had it since 2016 i am trying to get it removed and hope to by december doctor i am planning to go to a denist soon do you think if the hpv tumour has spread the damage will reverse itself and my body will go back to normal thank you again hi there are you looking for a specific expert your question sounds like youve already discussed this issue with one of us if youd like me to help you with your question could you explain what you mean by hpv tumor and maybe attach a clear photo dr lara i suppose the only way to avoid hpv after you remove is not to have sex again i will try to keep calm thank you doctor well i can still eat minus the coughing would i still be able to fight the virus now and be able to get well by december thank you soi dont ask my denist to bioopsy it for me thanks again not yet what would happen if i got it out would my body begin to fight the virus i cant send a picture oh i have tried but for some reason i cant get them to belive me and i have had to self diagnose myself i hope to find out soon i am going to a denist soon so i get the active hpv removed and then just wait to clear it thank again doctor this exact spot would not recur after having it removed again you can always be reinfected by hpv since you do not know that you actually have an hpv infection i think you should try to put this out of your mind until your appointment with a surgeon you may find that you do not even have hpv in your thats the thing i cant get poeple to listen about the lieson do you think if a denist found it and biopsy it would it just show hpv or cancer or would they not be able to tell not if it is located in your throat you would need to see an oral maxillofacial surgeon or an ent may i ask a clarifying question have you had any testing to confirm that you are actually infected with hpv have you been told by any type of doctor that you are definitely infected or are you just assuming that you have it and associating this coughing with hpv correct your dentist will not perform a biopsy in the throat region he or she will refer you to either an oral maxillofacial surgeon or an ent yes your dentist will know what to do you will explain your problem allow the dentist to perform an evaluation and then he or she will send you to the appropriate specialist for a biopsy yes certainly again more than 99 of hpv strains are totally harmless i recommend that you do not jump to the conclusion that you even do have hpv until you receive accurate test results okay i think i understand your question now am i correct in understanding that you are not sure that it is hpv but you think it might be and you want to know what to do from here okay that is alright if you cannot get me a photo i understand that you are concerned about this since you have not yet had a biopsy of this site can you tell me why you think it is hpv can you also describe what youre seeing and where it is located right i have had this for 58 months now and it is in the back of my throat but i am just coughing up white mucus so no blood would getting rid of oral hpv be easy i am also trying to get the hpv vaccine too can you tell me why you think this is hpv has a doctor diagnosed you with an hpvlesion in your throat would that also mean the far advanced viruses too like you just said the surgeon will remove it by surgically taking it out during the biopsy oh okay i see yes you can get rid of the virus as far as mutations go it is hard to say when and where it mutates there are lots of different strains of this virus so it definitely does mutate but i do not know of any research showing that it changes after you are infected with it 99 of the strains do i ask for a refreall from them after i tell them my problem thanks again no you would not know anything about any mutation no one knows that they have hpv until a doctor tests for it and tells them unless you had far advanced cancer but there is no way you would let it get that far without seeing a doctor the human body clears 99 of hpv infections okay so youve already had it biopsied and know that this spot in your mouth contains the hpv virus thank you so if i get it removed it would not come back again thank you okay i understand your concerns by asking your dentist to refer you to an oral maxillofacial surgeon or an ent for a biopsy you will get some clear answers i want to caution you against selfdiagnosing which can lead to increased anxiety for no reason best of luck to you dr lara does it usaually happen in the same day i have never done this before wait i got this by mistake if i dont mastabate again would that help that is how i got inially not usually you will schedule a consultation with the surgeon first he or she will discuss the lesion and all of your options if it was hpv how would they remove it you can always be reinfected with hpv so you must follow very strict safesex protocols thank doctor if it is a hpv type infection would my body be able to fight it even if i had it since 2016 today i learned now youre welcome please make sure to give me a rating hpv is transmitted from persontoperson if you were alone you could not have become infected with hpv what other questions can i help you with thanks i am male and so this is the first time i have had the virus and i hope i can get rid of it can the virus ever mutate thanks for your time doctor thank you could a denist remove do you think thank you so much goodbye thank you do you think it would come back again at all after that plase i would like to know what to do first of when i remove it how long would it take to go away and would it come back even with the vaccine in me by far advanced i mean that the virus has already caused a cancerous lesion that is far advanced in the throat this would be a tumor that causes noticeable problems like choking problems swallowing coughing and so on unless you already have active cancer from hpv you would not know that you have hpv without with your obgyn at a yearly visit if you are female as they can test for it specifically too it is important for you to know that most people clear the virus from their body naturally if you have the biopsy to remove the area youre worried about in your throat that will remove the site of the hpv hello again yes you should definitely try to stay calm until you get proof of an hpv infection at this time you do not actually know if you have it and if you do you could have one of the hundreds of strains that is harmless i

generally very good about attending but have on occasion had to cancel last min as i also have endo and i have suddenly got a bleed the suggestions to quaversplease to get a prepayment certificate i understand are trying to be helpful and helps a bit but still is the forseeable i had a smear test a month or so ago they are still carrying out these procedures the appointments are all by telephone unless its deemed necessary to see a gp or a nurse i had to get hold of antibiotics last week for my son i called at 8 30am the gp had called me by 9am as i got the anyways i lost 10 pounds and just got a pap smear yay me check you for signs of labor how far back your uterus is how thined out your cervix is and if you are dilated honestly it is a bit of an invasive exam but not unlike a pap smear you might experience a small amount of bleeding after but i never have b fleish get a root canal while getting a pap smear while getting a mammogram while getting a colonoscopy it sounds like youre on track my first appt was at 8 weeks and they did urine sample pap smear ultrasound and bloodwork so it sounds like everything you have had done they just did mine all at once next appt for me is 12 weeks they probably wouldnt check hcg again after about 6 weeks hcg is no longer a reliable source of information because the rise starts to slow i have only had one appointment at about 8 weeks and it was just an ultrasound and pap smear i have also had no urine samples or bloodwork yet my next appointment suzikell13 yes i had to have three biopsies before they got a positive for cancer came back negative twice but my ent surgeon was certain it was cancer it was an hpv positive tumor which responds much better to treatment b fleish i would rather get a pap smear everyday for a month i would rather have my gums scraped with rusty dental tools i would rather eat bugs for dinner i had a pap smear done today and my doctor was examining down there and she told me that it looked like my mucus plug hasnt formed yet im 15 weeks pregnant so shouldnt i have it by now if i have hpv will i ever have sex again op tinaburling90 i had abnormal smear pap smear so bad cells and had them removed so it weakens your cervix honestly i am sure you have nothing to worry about but no harm in talking to your doctor or consultant about it i felt silly the day i had the pains and i ended up being admitted straight away and ladies if you are 25 and havent had a smear test yet here is a reminder to book an appointment as soon as possible as far as i know they have changed the way they test they used to check for abnormal cells in everyone but now they only test for hpv if they find hpv they then invite you back for further investigation after my first smear last month they sent me a letter afterwards saying i am hpv negative so i do not had my first smear test had a letter to say i need to go back for another appointment to do a more indepth check but not received my results to tell me whats wrong i am upset and do not know what to think about this feel at a loss and i hate being an over thinker can anyone advise ops posts see next so just finally got through to the doctors explained my concern asked me multiple questions and told me i had abnormal cells with hpv bit all over the place as i am shocked but he said i am low risk and it is not cancer anyone else had this result ops posts see next see all oh wow have sentiments changed i started going to a gynecologist at 1213 i did get my period at 10 and had horrible horrible heavy periods so maybe thats why so young

can be fully effaced and a couple cm dilated for days or weeks before true labor starts just did my cervix check wasnt really painful just felt like a pap smear but more pressure and the doctor felt

i think not in my 20s my second boyfriend apparently had a past he did not tell me about i tested positive for hpv i was devastated for years my last two paps showed no hpv something that was supposedly going to be with me for life was gone i mean its not like they didnt try to give you two appointments before hand the pap smear was messed up but they didnt just go straight from 9 to 20 you missed them it isnt there fault people had already scheduled them before you everyones best interest to reschedule they said yes to call when she was better and i was sure i didnt catch what she had a few days later 13 weeks now my husband and i came down with a fever sore throat and coughs a few days into that he was tested for covid results were negative thank god but we you know that is a good question there are several therapeutic vaccines in development and i am just not familiar enough with their mechanism of action to know my guess is that it wouldnt be a problem simply because the gardasil is meant to create an immune response that is similar to what the body would the virus reactivate whereas others have not seen that there have been some individual case reports about people with really persistent hpv that got the vaccine and then improved but clearly it does not work for everyone and it is not clear who it might work for and under what circumstances but the long i think the one question i have is if the vaccine comes out to treat existing hpv through the clinical trials of immunotherapy will those people be able to get that as well or will it conflict with the guardasil what do you think towards if you have kids in the future or know loved ones tell them to get the shot i recently began escharotic treatments so youve had hpv for 18 years how are you doing my doctor recommended getting the guardasil vaccine even though ive had hpv for 18 years has anyone else been told to do that as far as i know its only effective prior to being infected with hpv not after if its beneficial ill get it but wanted to know what you guys had to say i have the high risk hi yes ive had it for 18 years now about 12 years ago i had a leepcone biopsy and have been fine up

smear but it in a turn of events it is extremely common figment imagine moinqueens mattyglesias it doesnt mean kids need to be vaccinated for every single thing like hpv rlydumbbitch fuck you did you get the gardasil shot in middle school mane they be killing me weightlifter1 i always avoided pap smears when i was pregnant with my son the little swab that they do on the entrance of your cervix never sat right with me and i believe there is evidence advising against it but obviously im no doctor they say its safe but that was always my preference and my joyfulmomma yes me too so i have my annual pap smear in a week and a half and ill ask them for a test while im there i live in central florida and i have an appointment check up every 4 weeks i had an ultrasound at 12 weeks and will have another at 20 weeks i got to hear the heartbeat on the doppler at the 16 week appointment my first appointment at 8 weeks was just a pap smear and to confirm the pregnancy via a urine whose pap smear is this oculus needs to hire some women if this is whats getting the green light tschofield14 i had my first appointment last week i go to newport news they did a pap smear gave me an order to get labs and ekg the doctor also went over what i should expect with my medical conditions and so on i have no complaints some have complained about the wait timetreatment but i had a good pattihatestrump katieogrady4 what if i told you that herd immunity with a virus was a myth a bacteria yes but a virus no that is like saying youre immune to herpes or hpv you might get it but the

stomach and then a quick pap smear i also got a birth control shot because they didnt have my iud in yet that they ordered i would call and ask i was out in 30 4 that may i received the second round of gardasil shortly after i began to notice a strange tingling sensation in my fingertips i realized touching things didnt quite have the same feeling it used to though i couldnt quite put my finger

last couple of smear tests myself whilst i am in there with the knowledge that i can burst into tears as soon as i get back in the car to go home this is a relatively new surgery for me and when i saw the nurse to register she was incredible so fingers crossed it is her doing it i second what whatifitallgoesright said about the fist under your back to tilt your pelvis certainly ask if your dp can attend although i doubt if they will let him to be honest a smear is a good opportunity to chat candidly to the nurse about your sexual health anyway so for this reason i would prefer to be alone if you call beforehand and explain they may allow it my sister suffers from anxiety and i was allowed in the room with her last week whilst she had a coil fitted could you try taking propanalol not sure

would allow him to be on the phone maybe even a video call not great but at least something it sounds like you need some counselling for this issue you cannot live the rest of your life not even being able to have your blood pressure taken because of anxiety it is a real issue and is clearly affecting your day to day life be a bit forceful about it i have to be because i need a little speculum or

sorry op during these times they may not allow it i do not think youve anything to lose by asking them i had a smear test last week and the nurse asked me as she called me in if i would like a chaperone so although maybe not your dp someone may be able to come in with you from the surgery ring the nurse and explain your anxieties she will be able to offer you a chaperone do not feel bad about it it is very common i have a real fear of the doctor absolutely no idea why i had to go in for a routine check up to get a repeat prescription the other week i asked in advance and they let my direct message come with me no problem xx my pap smear nurse offered to prescribe me valium to take before i went in to calm my nerves a doctor also told me that my cervix was slightly different angle to most women and to tell the nurses to head for my bum which seems to reduce the pain might be a daft idea but if you cannot take your dp in could you talk to him on the phone during the procedure

giving birth went in for a problem gyn visit bc i had a awful time getting off work and needed something after hours it was hands down the most compassionate and comfortable gyn service that is ever had lead me to get all 3 of my gardasil shots there as well its totally normal actually most doctors wont see you for an ultrasound until 8 weeks because before then it can be too early to see much and hear heartbeat i didnt have even a pregnancy confirmation until that 8 week ultrasound appointment so looks like they gave you confirmation early likely due to your thats normal i went in to confirm my pregnancy and was only 6wks they then scheduled my next appointment for 12wks since then i havent had an appointment yet however my anatomy scan is next tuesday i also had a loss before this pregnancy and they arent worried about it they think everything looks i think thats normal in fact im going through the same i had a loss at 7 weeks in august im now 6 weeks pregnant i only had blood work to confirm i was pregnant and now my doctor wont see me until 8 weeks since that is only had one loss she said im not high risk heres hoping for healthy pregnancies for both have a question

appointment if youre not allowed your dp with you perhaps another member of staff could sit with you offer reassurance and so on ring your surgery and ask to talk to the nurse that will do your smear chat through your concerns and give them the info ahead again about the things you need i dont think youll be allowed your dp with you but they may agree please go even if he cant though they arent nice and i understand the anxiety i absolutely dont think theres anything wrong with wanting to take dp in under normal circumstances im a bit suck it up and would love to tell you to just deal with it but i know in reality its not that simple so if it helps then carry on i dont think it makes you pathetic however not right now i dont think youd be allowed at the moment i have seen lots online

exam and surprised me with a mini ultrasound they had a little handheld one that looked like a large phone screen and i got how long does a pap smear take kmw1314 also in my experience the cells they found were exactly what they found on the pap smear but my moms were a bit more advanced than they thought so they were able to go ahead and take out that small area it is such a slow growing thing that you will most likely clear it but even if you do not hi there im 12 weeks pregnant with my first baby and i just got my results back from my pap i had done at my first appointment a few weeks ago it showed that i had atypical cells and i also found out that im positive for hpv 16 obviously this is scary news to get especially when you are pregnant ive had a hpv test in the past it cleared on its own ive also had a colposcopy with an endocervical biopsy not when i was pregnant where they can look closer for any abnormal cells when they do the biopsy it can give you some mild cramping like period cramps petrutac they have checked my cervical length with a vaginal probe but checked if i was dilated or effaced by doing a classic cervical check similar to pap smear but with fingers i assume thats the normal way right she said it would only take a minute and was a fill in for my normal doctor hey all im so annoyed and upset im on the verge of just giving up i literally cry every

causes irregular cells on the cervix beginning of this year i wanna say around february from there i had a colposcopy in mayjune and regular paps every 3 months i just recently got another pap done

for herpes or hpv unless you have an active infection or your history genital warts can very well be connected with hpv unfortunately i have them too d4dubs they definitely are different hpv can causes warts among other things hsv causes lesionsblisters both are viruses hpv does go away in the sense that you do not have an active infection that will spread but it can reoccur maybabyday hpv is so common especially in older 30 women a lot of times it goes undetected men are symptomless and can spead it i am 31 and i remember i was one of the first people to get the vaccine at like 18 now they offer the vaccine for children boys and girls hopefully were moving to a i am pretty sure that hsv is forever it is like having the virus that causes cold sores hsv1 but for your genitals hsv2 you can have flare ups but you carry the virus forever a lot of people on this thread are mentioning hpv which is not the same thing definitely speak to a doc before you go accusing d4dubs hsv is forever technically hpv is too but there are so many strains it was genital warts caused by hpv which is good technically bc the strain that causes warts is unlikely to be the type that cause cervical cancer not from hsv but yes he was aware of my sexual history odds were not in my d4dubs i got the vaccine and wound up with hpv anywayevidently my bf of 3 5 years had a flare up recently and gave it to meive never tested positive before the vaccine only covers certain strains from my understanding genital warts typically means you have hpv and i believe it can come and go i could be wrong but thats been my understanding i would hold off on being too upset until you speak with your doctor because it is likely it could just be that i gotcha i had hpv at 19 i had negative paps followed by

cells that are common during pregnancy and this time around the pap came out clear try not to stress too much until you can speak to your doctor i wouldnt freak out yet i could be wrong but i believe you can have some abnormal cells and still be completely fine do you have an online portal where you can ask your doctor for clarification dont freak out i have had 2 consecutive abnormal paps the first one i freaked out like you but they did a procedure called a colposcopy sp and it came back fine this time around she just looked closer and said there wasnt anything to be concerned about she said just some hpv giving you trouble hey guys so i received a call from the first doctor i went to about my pap smear and they said it came out abnormal im like freaking out i had an abnormal pap at the start of my second pregnancy and my midwife had a wait and see approach she said in a lot of cases birth can help slough off the abnormal bits it evidently worked for me because pap at my postpartum was normal again welp health anxiety for the win once again that is been having female issues pretty sure i have a yeast infection or something however i took to doctor google and began

women believe the human papilloma virus hpv vaccine protects against ovarian cancer it does not and frighteningly more than 1800 australian women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year by 2025 about a thousand of those women thanks bo there is more to this story than meets the eye in my opinion excerpt from sa articlethe head of the trump administrations operation warp speed program moncef slaoui expects drugmakers to file with the fda for emergency authorization of a coronavirus vaccine by late november the project aims to deliver 300m doses of a vaccine starting in january though none of the four vaccine candidates to enter phase 3 trials have yet publicly reported data from the midstage studies my expectation is really something between 80 and 90 efficacy he added saying immunization in highrisk populations could begin this year between november and january we will have enough vaccines to immunize i would say 80m to 100m people which represents all the elderly people the health care workers the first line workers after that we start to immunize the less risky populations if you look at it over a period of six seven months between november and june we will be immunizing a very large number of people month on month every month starting with the most risky the most impacted toward the least impacted people i am disappointed that politicians have embarked into communication processes and media in a way that has created so much angst around this process were forgetting something which is people are dying and forgetting another thing which is never ever before has an effort of this proportion been made and vaccines been developed in a period of less than a year were not running smaller trials were running bigger trials than usual i hope this never happens again that such events are politicized transparency transparency transparency is the name of the game we are committed to make available every data httpsseekingalpha comnews3621297headofoperationwarpspeedseesemergencyauthorizationvaccinerequestaroundthanksgivingso heres the thing moncef slaoui worked for gsk for 30 years and eventually ran the company no one understands the power of adjuvanted recombinant subunit protein vaccines better than the head of ows shingrix ring any bells how about cervarix both have efficacy in the 90 range in my opinion i am sure shared by those doing their dd and listening to red the only company capable of having a curriculum vitae vaccine as described by moncef with efficacy in the 8090 range is nvax that is why the p2

either all the sexually transmitted infections can be transmitted through oral sexyou can have oral hpvoral chlamydia and so on yes the infection can spread by touching you should avoid touching the

help they do clear but takes months i have hpv and recently developed genital warts ive been doing at home treatment and need a few questions answered how long have you had the warts have these been constant or something that comes and goes just developed them about 2 months ago but were small they are just a pain to look at i have never hiwhen the wart will turn white and wrinkled this is normal

in the last month or so ive used a product for genital warts at home and they have turned really white does this mean that they are going to go away im just trying to find the best way to get rid of them without having to go back to the obgyn every week for treatment nothis type of virus can not cause cancer it is low risk virus it can only cause warts should i continue using the product if they are turning white or should i just leave them alone and let them go away naturally in your profession have you seen genital warts clear up on their own or do people normally have them for a long period of time in your profession have you seen general warts clear up on their own or do people normally have them for a long period of time will they spread to your mouth the warts are really white

also was pretty quick i did not have any spotting earlier in my pregnancy though hope this helps i had my pap smear at 8 weeks and had very little spotting i had my pap smear at 7 weeks my doctor was very gentle and she tried to get my attention away from that by cracking jokes i had no spotting at all afterwards hello i was in the same boat first time mom and first time having a pap smear i spotted 5 days after my pap smear it was only a little brown smudge my doctor did not seem very concerned so im supposed to have my pap smear done in the beginning of november but my doctor asked if i just wanted to wait until my pages previous poster check up and i said sure she just did that if i feel anything weird going on to let them know and they would just do a quick swab i had really bad bleeding i seem to always be a pap slacker so i have needed one while i was pregnant with all 3 of my babies the first 2 i spotted after the pap a day or two but only a very small amount and brown this 1 i had some spotting here and there in the early weeks of pregnancy and i thought for sure i would spot after my pap oh the title of pap smear pregnancy makes you me weird anyways this is my first pregnancy and i was surprised when they said id have my pap done at this next visit ill be 11 6 wks i know it makes sense that they want to make sure all is ok but it also makes me nervous that ill bleed just no spotting but i definitely had cramping for the rest of the day after which made me nervous i had one at the beginning of my first pregnancy and i did have spotting and a little cramping for a day or two after just remember that its definitely normal and just a result of the pap smear nothing to worry about i had 1 with my first pregnancy much later for the strep b test to see if i would need antibiotics at delivery this pregnancy i had a pap smear that was due and the trans vaginal ultrasound at the first visit 10 weeks and wont have another until the strep b swab i

suggest it is 2 shots now my 19yo dcs have not gotten it now they can decide for themselves i was not giving it to them a study came out last week showing that at the population level the risk of cervical cancer in women who received the vaccine under age 18 reduced their chances by 88 and between 18 and 30 by 53 ds np my ds had 3 shots at 11 12 13 why wouldnt you id be really mad as a young

got it a couple years after him and only had to get 2 shots are they gay which countries every vaccine has risks that is true but the risks are minimal compared to this level of reducing cancer and im no pharma shill and my kids have sn and are needle phobic i would trust them over a ybm dr why do people like this this is one of those rare times when you can prevent cancer me we have not given to either child 13 15yo dislike all you want it is the truth you can get it as early as 11 you should get it before 15 b cause once they turn 15 its three shots instead of 2 has anyone here not given their dcs gardasil vaccine as does any vaccine miniscule risks it has been banned in several countries for years exactly there are many risks with it i did even though my ex said not to that is the

other disease the difference is it prevents cancer not just the mumps yes it changed a few years ago between 11 and 14 its 2 shots once they turn 15 its 3 shots but as long as its 17 or under they get the maximum protection why not will your boys not have sex will you not have dils someday read up on side effects infertility paralysis and so on do your own research you are a parent it is your job

of cervical cancer for those under age 18 88 and those 18 to 30 53 they believe the difference is because the younger group received it before having any exposure no thanks ok 23 of people the

exposure to hpv why if i want to skip my period next month if i dont take the placebo pills in my next pack will i bleed again i will continue taking it but ive been bleeding for 2 weeks straight and i want it to stop so bad okay got it i am typing my response now you can ignore any automated phone call requests wait i dont dont understand how to do that but will my bleeding go away because i want it gone as soon as possible how many active non placebo pills do you have left in your current pack hello i am dr r an obgyn specialist i will do my best to address your question i am sorry to hear youre having unscheduled bleeding with levlen first how long have you been taking levlen and can you describe the bleeding youre having youre welcome glad to help thanks for using just answer and you have a good evening yes your unscheduled bleeding was due to skipping the placebo pills as 30 of women have unscheduled bleeding when they only take active pills so after the placebo pills with your current pack the unscheduled bleeding should be gone are you sure and is that all i need to do it will stop after the period you have with the placebo pills and you should not have unscheduled bleeding with your next pack it is too late to stop it with two active pills a day this pack since you only have 4 left then you should ask your provider if they think you need to change pills i do not think that will be necessary since you did not have unscheduled bleeding when you were taking the placebo pills before skipping them so taking them this way again should not result in unscheduled bleeding the fact you did not i was recommended the 4 day break so last week monday i stopped taking the pills and during that time i got a heavy period i started taking the pill again on friday and the bleeding got a lot lighter but hasnt stopped yet that is been on levlen for 2 months and an on the pack of the 3rd month i decided to skip the placebo pills during the second month and continue with the pills then i got breakthrough bleeding what if it isnt gone okay since you only have 4 pills left i would just finish this pack once a day taking the placebo pills my question is about birth control are you using any contraceptives when did your last period begin im using levlen and i wont stop bleeding test and what were the results any swelling discoloration or unusual smells whats a pap test doctors assistant anything else in your medical history you there is a higher chance of unscheduled or breakthrough bleeding when taking the birth control pill continuously skipping placebo pills stopping it for 4 days can be helpful but if youre still bleeding lightly i would recommend you finish your current pack and take the placebo pills you can try i have 4 active pills left you can try it again but it could cause unscheduled bleeding as i mentioned 30 of women have unscheduled bleeding when they only take the active pills it might work better if you take 2 more pill packs with the placebo pills then try skipping them again that would give your body a chance to adjust to thankyou for your help i really appreciate it okay then you can do the following take 2 pills a day morning and evening until you finish the active pills that should stop your unscheduled bleeding within a day or two then follow the twice daily active pill by taking the placebo pills september 28th test and what were the results any swelling discoloration or unusual smells last pap test was in 2019 it was ok i found brown spottings before the day of my last period doctors assistant anything else

any states experience with hpv vaccination mandates offers another process tip vaccine manufacturers should stay on the sidelines the hpv vaccine manufacturers direct involvement in crafting and lobbying for mandate legislation raised suspicion that profit rather than public health motives lay behind such irmafaylear what if they had hpv would you feel the same it happens all the time the reason it will not be recommended over 50 will be because the vaccine will not have been tested on people over the age of 50 so it is not licensed for use in over 50s this is why you can only get hpv which you would have to pay for yourself as a female adult up to the age of 45 i would happily have my friend dennis died from colorectal cancer caused by hpv which he contacted by having unprotected anal sex he also lived with hiv for decades but what killed him was the result of hpv infection hpv i wonder if vampires picky about the blood they get yk folks be having hpv and hepititus and these motherfuckers deadass going after prostitutes in 18 century new orleans i do not understand surely dh already has it considering i must have had it for at least 10 years and it is been 3 years since my smear so flare up could have started anytime in that 3 years and what treatment can you get if there are no cell changes think it is shaken me up more than i thought as i was dreaming about it last night i had a feeling this smear wouldnt come back completely normal i know it is lucky the cells have not changed yet but now i have got to wait a year worrying that they will 14833697 get what hpv

much this exactly my mother was told to hold off on her chemo due to covid and as a result her cancer markers ticked up significantly during the three months she was off treatment that is a real problem i have no sympathy for op at all 100 zero sympathy for the can handle this pretty much this exactly my mother was told to hold off on her chemo due to covid and as a result her cancer markers ticked up significantly during the three months she was off treatment that is a real problem i have no sympathy for op at all came as a bit of a shock to be honest after all the negative tests i have also been married years and pretty sure he has not cheated but then i know i must have had it all those years ago i just do not really think i understood hpv and that it is there for life but can flare up i am going to find some decent multi following with interest as am in the same position annual testing some have come back positive some negative despite having only been with dh in the last 10 years am due another smear in a couple of weeks time last years one was positive so will see if the hpv has gone again this time could someone please explain this to me ive wondered for years and never quite got to the bottom of it so if someone has had hpv and tested positive then in subsequent years smears have come back clear does this mean that hpv has gone would that person then still have the same risks of developing just had the results of my smear and it says that i have tested negative for hpv so therefore they wont be testing for abnormal cervical cells even if ive had them before because the risk is low i am appalled i went through a smear test for them not to to even bother testing for abnormal cells what the fuck even the symptoms i had were breakthrough bleeding and bleeding after sex also sometimes if i went for a particularly hard run i thought it was just to do with my copper coil as it started not long after i had that put in i had a smear test and that made me bleed too then it got sent off and within 2 weeks i no if you have a screening that picks something up then you go for other diagnostic tests if you have other symptoms that indicate that you could possibly have something they send you right to the diagnostic tests there is no reason to send you for screening at that point discontentedwoman this is bollocks because cervical screening used to workexactlythis way every sample examined fully as i understand it research suggested there were too many false positives cell abnormalities that would not have developed into cervical cancer were treated with a cervical cancer someonesayroadtrip if a woman has symptoms such as bleeding between periods bleeding after sex pain discharge and so on she needs referral to gynae for colposcopy examination not a smear at her gp surgery smears or primary hpv screening as it is now called are a screening tool not an assessment or glad you got the all clear chesney that seems like a quick turnaround thank goodness in my earlier post i should have added i went on to have a cone biopst no idea whether it is such a thing now but was done yunder general anaesthetic and a horrendous 2 week wait for results cin 3 was detected was detected after a normal smear result previously i had no symptoms whatsoever and was yes yabu but this kind of feeling is not unusual because a lot of people do not really understand that screening is not that straightforward it used to be assumed that the more screening in all kinds of areas the better youd catch more cancer or problems and be able to fix them what more studies have cantbutwill thank you it really was my friend who had it last year but had a radical hysterectomy for her treatment still tests positive for hpv i do not know if i still am or not to be honest it was not mentioned again i guess i will find out at my next smear i am hoping the chemo or radio will have killed it off thank you for the 3 in 10 explanation i feel less worried now i forget who asked but my nurse said there was absolutely no way to have a sample further examined and to ask for a gynae referral if still concerned yes thespotyedzebra if your cervix had any visual changes they would also refer you me too it was intense yo m worried that something will be wrong do we ttc on the fertile week this month and then have the smear towards af week or do i just book it for whenever and then miss this month ttc i am worried now that the cin cells have come back so i will need the lletz again and that it will hamper actually getting a results were published in the new england journal of medicine researchers found t 19 women who had received the quadrivalent hpv vaccine were diagnosed with cervical cancer compared to 538 women who had not received the vaccine the cumulative rate of cervical cancer was 47 cases per 10 people among women disneychrista said i guess i misreadunderstood what you wrote however right now testing positive for covid means you have the disease whether you are sick or not where with hiv similarly hpv you can have the virus and never get sick from aids or diagnosed with cancer click to expand no right now means you have the disease whether you are sick or not where with hiv similarly hpv you can have the virus and never get sick from aids or diagnosed with cancer wow a 50 reduction from the abstract of this paper on hpv vaccination the cumulative incidence of cervical cancer was 47 cases per 10 persons among women who had been vaccinated and 94 cases per 10 persons among those who had not been vaccinated kubej9

covid19 is not the only thing trump caught from hicks belive me i am trying would i start seeing results by this year hope so thank you i have tried to take it but no luck it costs so much would my gp help me with that do you think one last question doctor if i took the hpv vaccine would it get rid of my oral hpv i already have thanks actually i am having problems getting tested noone belives me when i tell them could i beat the virus this year if i hurry thank you thank you so much i have to say the thing about hpv is that you cant tell people or anything even if they have it too is oral hpv really a lot more tricky to get rid off even with the vaccine in your system ah is that how hpv works i know it is a sti would i even know if it became cancerous or would they not be able to find out storry for asking some say the vaccine doesent get rid of present hpv you already have i guess it depends on the vaccine thank yoou doctor hpv in the throat i had it since 2016 and so i have had it for 58 months could i get rid of it by the end of the year i also have another hpv on my penis thanks the immune system of the body is usually enough for any active hpv infection to prevent further hpv infections the hpv vaccine is available and is very effective if your hpv lesions are still persistent especially the penile one it can be surgically removed the throat one would be tricker a not tricky really it is cleared by the body if the immunity levels are high tried i saw other doctors and they gave me capsules for acid reflux oh and and i saw the same doctor 3 times who does not belive in hpv at all anyway i hope this works thank you hang in there you will find a resolution soon you are most welcome can you please accept and rate my answer if you are texting you will get a link to rate soon if you are on the website the rating is on the top of the page thank you the next time you have a dental question you can directly post it yes there is no guarantee that is correct you are welcome take care yes your gp can surely guide you about getting the vaccine in the best way possible please see himher as soon as you can hello what kind of hpv infection do you have dr behere it really depends on how strong your immune system is boost your immunity by taking vitamin supplements eating healthy and doing regular exercise have you taken the vaccine already it would certainly help yes thank you would it shrink the oral leison i have a question if someone had a persistant hpv infection for 58 months could they still get rid of it by lets say december i have had mine since 2016 i am very sure it is not cancerous or you would know my strong advice to you would be to visit your gp as soon as you can have you seen one since 2016 if not do not delay any more yes you will do not worry and do not stress about it stress is also detrimental to the immune system projectlincoln if i was melania i would also get tested for pubic lice chancroid hpv syphilis and so on i am sure

changes in cells finally got that smear recently over a year late my fault and the results say i tested negative for hpv no mention of cells im a bit worried now that ive read this thread because i as theluggage15 says do not confuse screening with investigations any symptomatic woman regardless of age last smear interval or result or history would be referred under a two week wait if there was a suspicion of cervical cancer this means examination and colposcopy with a gynaecologist not a smear during my latest one a polyp was found the sample was taken from it and i was able to discuss my options about it in relation to my medical history the thing that is a real worry is that this wasnt explained properly at the time of the smear to give meaningful consent to the test you should be clear about what they are testing for my cervical screening reminder came with a leaflet that explained it and the nurse also explained at the time she did the i am confused by the change too i have only ever had one sexual partner and he has only ever been with me so i am hpv clear i still have had smears tests i am currently symptomatic a whole other thread and had a smear but only tested me for hpv i realise the risk is less than 1 but surely if patients maybe the national health service should call it hpv screening which is what it now is and drop the cervical bit altogether hpv isnt just sexually transmitted its often transmitted by poor hygiene too the kind you get in some parts of india and africa all of my virgin aunts and they were virgins had hpv and all died of either cervical anal or vulvar cancer same here cin3 25 years ago now and underwent a colposcopy went on to have annual smears for 10 years then put on to normal standard testing i had a smear test recently and i think my wait is now 5 years between smears and was shocked to discover they only test for hpv in the back of your mind you always vaginal cancer penile cancer and some types of neck and head cancers this is why people fought and went private for boys to be included in getting vaccine protection w national health service ukconditionshumanpapillomavirushpv this is a far better method and will actually mean they are better able to focus on those at risk if you have cervical cancer symptoms you shouldnt have a smear its a screening test not a diagnostic test then you bleed after sex and your gp says well your last smear was fine then what your gp does not say that your gp takes a full medical history examines you sends off tests and if necessary refers you to gynaecology the screening programme is for people without symptoms this is bollocks because cervical screening used to work exactly this way every sample examined fully yes but theyve since realised through research that hpv testing is better than cytology they didnt used to test every sample for both hpv and abnormal cells what service do you propose getting rid of in order to test all of these extra smear tests for abnormal cells if we had limitless resources then yes test them all why not but since we do not adding an extra load in one area involves getting rid of one somewhere else if you have a large scale statistical i am worried about this too april 2018 i had lettz for cin3 i was hpv negative at the time my 6m follow up in october showed i was hpv negative so they wouldnt be checking for abnormal cells how can this be when the reason for this smear itself was to make sure i did not have any abnormal cells still as and is it possible to have any smear examined fully if it is hpv

at smokers if your biopsies are normal but you are still carrying hpv they will just keep you on annual smears as far as i know i have had 3 x smears that showed high risk hpv but i also had got an
